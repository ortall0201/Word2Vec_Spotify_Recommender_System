Word2Vec NLP Project
This repository contains my final data science course project, where I explore how Word2Vec can be applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It demonstrates how to train word embeddings and evaluate semantic relationships between words.

Project Overview
Goal: Demonstrate how Word2Vec can be used to learn vector representations of words and capture semantic relationships within a text corpus.
Course Context: This project was part of my final assignment in a data science course, focusing on end-to-end NLP workflows.
Getting Started
Clone the Repo

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/word2vec-nlp-project.git
Install Dependencies

Python 3.x
Gensim
NLTK (or any other libraries you used)
matplotlib or seaborn (if you include visualizations)
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Include a requirements.txt file if possible.)

Download or Prepare Your Data

Place your text corpus in the data/ folder, or update the notebook paths to point to your dataset.
Notebook Highlights
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Shows how text data was tokenized and prepared for training.
Word2Vec Model Training: Includes details on hyperparameters (vector size, window size, min_count, etc.) and training steps using Gensim (or another library).
Evaluation: Demonstrates how to evaluate word embeddings via:
Word similarity checks
t-SNE or PCA visualizations for embedding inspection
Insights & Observations: Presents the model’s performance and potential improvements.
How to Use
Open the Jupyter Notebook

bash
Copy
Edit
cd word2vec-nlp-project
jupyter notebook
Run Cells Step-by-Step
Follow the instructions within the notebook cells to reproduce the results or modify parameters for experimentation.

Modify/Reuse
Feel free to adapt the code for your own text data or different parameter settings to see how it affects the learned word embeddings.
